# WA Mining Portfolio — Data Pipeline & Full-Stack Application

[![CI](https://github.com/tonynguyen1292/WA_Mining/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tonynguyen1292/WA_Mining/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A PostgreSQL-backed system for Western Australia's public Major Resources Projects dataset (MINEDEX): a SQL data pipeline that cleans and models the raw government export, and a FastAPI + React application built on top of it for exploring the portfolio interactively. A Power BI dashboard remains available as an alternative reporting surface on the same data.

### The app

**Dashboard** — portfolio-wide KPIs and live-filtered breakdowns; chart bars click through to the matching filtered Sites view, the top-10 LGA and multi-site-project panels surface the cleaned `lga_name` data and the site-vs-project grain, and the footer records data provenance:

![Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard.png)

**Sites** — the full 421-site table, filterable and sortable (shown here sorted by Stage, descending), with CSV export of the current filtered view:

![Sites table](screenshots/sites-table.png)

**Map** — every matching site plotted by location and colored by stage (shown here filtered to Gold):

![Map view](screenshots/map-view.png)

**Command palette** (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K`) — jump straight to any site from anywhere in the app:

![Command palette](screenshots/command-palette.png)

### Power BI dashboard (legacy)

**Overview page** — portfolio-wide snapshot (commodity, stage, region breakdowns):

![Dashboard overview page](POWER_BI/screenshots/dashboard_overview.png)

**Regional and Operational View** — drill-down by region, project, and site type:

![Dashboard regional and operational view](POWER_BI/screenshots/dashboard_regional_analysis.png)

`wa_mining_dashboard_v2.pbix` is the current version — it corrects region/LGA name suffixes that `v1` still has.

## Project Overview

This project takes a raw government export of WA mining, infrastructure, and petroleum sites and turns it into an analysis-ready data model, then exposes it two ways:

- **The app** (`backend/` + `frontend/`) — a live, filterable dashboard, sortable sites explorer, and map view. This is the primary, actively developed interface. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) to run it, or [Application Architecture](#application-architecture) for how it's built.
- **The original SQL pipeline + Power BI** (`SQL/`, `POWER_BI/`) — the pipeline that defines the cleaning rules, run for real (not just ported) to produce the cleaned dataset the app itself seeds from (`DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/`), plus a static Power BI dashboard on the same rules. See [System / Workflow Summary](#system--workflow-summary).

**Why both exist:** Power BI already answered the reporting question on this data. The app exists because reporting isn't the same job as exploring — Power BI needs Power BI Desktop installed and a `.pbix` file to open, while the app is a URL: no license, works on a phone, and (per the priority order in [WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md)) a specific filtered/sorted/paginated view is itself a shareable link, in a way a static report file can't be.

The CSV snapshot currently included in this repo (`DATABASES/raw/Major_Resource_Projects.csv`) contains 421 site records across 356 distinct projects.

## How This Was Built

This is a solo project, built with Claude (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) as a pair-programming tool for scaffolding, refactoring, and documentation drafts — you'll see it credited as a co-author in the commit history. The parts that matter are mine: the problem framing, the site-vs-project grain decision, the data-cleaning business rules, the API and schema design, and every trade-off documented in *Key Engineering Decisions* below. I treat AI assistance the way I'd treat any power tool — it speeds up the typing, not the thinking — and I can walk through any file in this repo and explain why it looks the way it does.

That extends to how problems get handled, not just how features get built. When a downloaded CSV export looked "uncleaned," the useful first move wasn't to guess at a fix — it was to reproduce it. It didn't reproduce: the live data and the export turned out to be byte-identical, verified row by row. But that same investigation surfaced a real, separate risk worth fixing anyway — the cleaning rules existed in two hand-maintained places (an SQL pipeline and a Python port of it) that could in principle drift apart, even though they hadn't yet — so that's what got fixed instead of a bug that wasn't there (see *Key Engineering Decisions*). The same discipline shows up earlier in the history: a SQLite connection-pooling bug caught by a test that was supposed to pass, and a stale-results bug in the command palette found by deliberately re-reviewing it after shipping rather than waiting for a user to hit it. Every feature in this repo ships with the test suite that would catch its regressions (`backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/**/*.test.ts(x)`), enforced in CI on every push — not just "it worked when I tried it."

## Problem Statement

The source dataset is a flat CSV with data-quality issues typical of a raw government export: inconsistent region/LGA labels (suffixes like ", SHIRE OF"), two overlapping status encodings (`STAGE` and `SYMBOL_STATUS`), and a site-vs-project grain mismatch — a single project can have multiple sites (mine, processing plant, port), so naive counting double-counts projects. Before any reporting is possible, the data has to be cleaned and modeled with an explicit grain decision. That's what the SQL layer in this repo does.

## System / Workflow Summary

This SQL pipeline is the single, actually-executed source of truth for the cleaning rules — not just a reference copy. Earlier, `backend/app/db/seed.py` re-implemented the same TRIM/INITCAP/suffix-handling logic by hand in Python, reading the raw CSV directly; that carried a real risk of the two implementations quietly drifting apart. Now the pipeline is run for real against a scratch database, its output (`sites`) is exported to `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv`, and `seed.py` just loads that already-clean file — one cleaning implementation, not two.

```
Major_Resource_Projects.csv (DATABASES/raw/)
        │
        ▼
SQL/01_create_raw_table.sql    →  staging_sites (raw load, all columns as TEXT)
        │
        ▼
SQL/02_create_clean_table.sql  →  sites (typed, cleaned schema, incl. title/short_title)
SQL/03_insert_cleaned_data.sql →  cleaning + standardization applied on insert
        │
        ▼
SQL/04_create_summary_view.sql →  views: sites_by_commodity, sites_by_stage,
                                    sites_by_region, sites_by_type
SQL/05_portfolio_summary.sql   →  portfolio_summary rollup table
        │
        ├──▶ Power BI (POWER_BI/wa_mining_dashboard_v2.pbix)
        │
        ▼
`\copy sites TO ...` export
        │
        ▼
Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv (DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/)
        │
        ▼
backend/app/db/seed.py  →  the app's own `sites` table (Postgres, live-queried by the API)
```

`SQL/run_all.sql` runs `01`→`05` in one pass — see *Setup / How to Run (legacy SQL + Power BI)* below for how to regenerate the cleaned CSV from a fresh raw download.

The PostgreSQL database (`wa_mining`) is the source of truth for the analytical model; Power BI connects to it and replicates part of the `portfolio_summary` logic in DAX for interactive slicing (see *Key Engineering Decisions*). The app's own database is a separate instance, seeded from the exported cleaned CSV rather than sharing a live connection with whatever database this pipeline is run against.

## Application Architecture

The SQL pipeline above produces the data the app starts from; from that point on, the app doesn't share any code with it — this is its own request flow.

```
Browser (React + TypeScript, Vite)
        │
        │  fetch() via frontend/src/api/client.ts
        │  filters, page, and sort live in the URL query
        │  string (frontend/src/utils/urlFilters.ts), not
        │  just component state -- any view is a shareable,
        │  reloadable link. Ctrl/Cmd+K opens a global search
        │  modal (CommandPalette.tsx) from any route.
        ▼
FastAPI (backend/app/main.py + api/routes/)
        │
        │  backend/app/services/portfolio_service.py: one
        │  shared filter + sort + tiebreaker implementation
        │  behind /api/sites (paginated JSON),
        │  /api/sites/export (the same view, unpaginated, as
        │  a CSV download), and /api/kpis (aggregated
        │  breakdowns) alike -- so the three can't quietly
        │  drift apart from each other.
        ▼
PostgreSQL (`sites` table)
```

The most-exercised part of this flow is the `/api/sites` ↔ `SitesPage.tsx` round trip: filter or sort there, and the URL, the network request, and the browser's back/forward history all stay in sync with what's on screen.

## Key Engineering Decisions

- **Grain:** modeled at site level, not project level, to preserve operational asset detail — multiple sites can map to a single project code (`PROJ_CODE`); this repo's snapshot has 421 sites across 356 projects.
- **Schema:** a single flat, typed table (`sites`) rather than a star schema — the snapshot data doesn't have update/history requirements that would justify one.
- **Commodity dimension:** `TARGET_GROUP_NAME` is used as the primary commodity field instead of the raw `COMMODITIES` column, which stores pipe-delimited multi-value lists that aren't directly groupable.
- **Status field:** `STAGE` is used as the primary status dimension; `SYMBOL_STATUS` (a second, overlapping status encoding in the source data) is kept only for cross-checking, not as a reporting field.
- **String cleaning:** region and LGA names are standardized in SQL (`TRIM`, `INITCAP`, and `CASE`-based suffix handling in `03_insert_cleaned_data.sql`) rather than in Power Query, so the cleaning logic lives with the data model and is re-runnable independent of the BI tool.
- **DAX/SQL parity:** the Power BI measures replicate the `portfolio_summary` SQL logic (COUNT/CASE patterns) rather than reimplementing separate business logic in DAX from scratch.
- **One cleaning implementation, not two:** the app's seed step (`backend/app/db/seed.py`) used to read the raw CSV and re-implement `03_insert_cleaned_data.sql`'s TRIM/INITCAP/suffix rules by hand in Python. Verified byte-for-byte equivalent at the time (421 rows × 14 columns, zero mismatches), but still a second place the same rules had to be kept in sync by hand. `seed.py` now loads `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv` — the actual, executed output of `SQL/01`–`05` — so there's exactly one implementation of the cleaning rules to maintain.

## Challenges and Trade-offs

| Challenge | Approach taken |
|---|---|
| Mixed asset types (mine, infrastructure, deposit, other) in one source table | Segmented using `TARGET_GROUP_NAME` and `SITE_TYPE`, documented in `data_dictionary.md` |
| Multi-commodity fields with pipe-delimited lists | Used the cleaned `TARGET_GROUP_NAME` single-value field instead of parsing `COMMODITIES` |
| Region/LGA names with inconsistent suffixes (e.g. ", SHIRE OF") | Handled in SQL with `CASE`-based text transforms during the clean-table insert |
| Site-to-project duplicate counting | Exposed both project-level and site-level counts as separate measures in Power BI, rather than picking one and hiding the ambiguity |
| No capital-cost field in the source dataset | Out of scope for this version — noted explicitly in `data_dictionary.md` rather than estimated or backfilled |
| `05_portfolio_summary.sql` only buckets 4 of the 6 real `STAGE` values (`Operating`, `Proposed`, `Care and Maintenance`, `Under Development`) | Known gap — `Undeveloped` (33 sites) and `Shut` (3 sites) currently fall outside the per-stage breakdown, though they're still included in `total_sites`. Not fixed in this pass; tracked in Future Improvements |

## Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** — system of record, both for the original SQL pipeline and the FastAPI app's `sites` table
- **FastAPI + SQLAlchemy** — read-only API over the cleaned portfolio data (`backend/`)
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** — dashboard, sites explorer, map, and site detail pages (`frontend/`)
- **Recharts** — portfolio breakdown charts
- **Leaflet + react-leaflet** — the map view (free OpenStreetMap tiles, no API key)
- **pytest** — backend tests, against an in-memory SQLite DB (`backend/tests/`)
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** — frontend tests (`frontend/src/**/*.test.ts(x)`)
- **Docker Compose** — local dev (`docker-compose.yml`) and a production-like build (`docker-compose.prod.yml`, nginx-served frontend)
- **GitHub Actions** — CI: backend lint/compile/test, frontend test/typecheck/build
- **Power BI + DAX** — dashboard and interactive reporting (legacy/reference reporting surface)
- **Git / GitHub** — version control and documentation
- **Jira** — active backlog and sprint tracking (see *Further Reading*)
- **Notion** — early-stage planning docs, superseded by the Jira backlog (see *Further Reading*)

## Getting Started

The app is a complete, runnable full-stack application (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React) — the originally planned feature roadmap is fully delivered (see [WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md) for what shipped and why, in order). Component-level detail lives in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) and [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md); this section is the fastest path to a running app.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (running, not just installed) — or a local PostgreSQL install if you'd rather skip Docker (see Step 2's native option)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and npm, for the frontend

### Step 1 — Clone and enter the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/tonynguyen1292/WA_Mining
cd WA_Mining
```

### Step 2 — Start PostgreSQL + the backend API

```
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the FastAPI image and starts two containers: `db` (Postgres 16) and `backend` (the API, with hot reload). First run pulls the base images, so it can take a minute or two.

<details>
<summary>Prefer no Docker? Native backend setup</summary>

```
createdb wa_mining
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate   # or source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # edit DATABASE_URL if your local Postgres differs
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Run the seed command in Step 3 with plain `python -m app.db.seed` instead of the `docker compose exec` form.
</details>

### Step 3 — Seed the database

In a second terminal, with the stack from Step 2 still running:

```
docker compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed
```

This loads `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv` — the output of actually running `SQL/01`–`05` against the raw CSV (see [System / Workflow Summary](#system--workflow-summary)) — and populates the `sites` table. It's safe to re-run — it clears and reloads `sites` each time. You should see `Seeded 421 sites from Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv`.

### Step 4 — Verify the backend

Open http://localhost:8000/docs — you should see the interactive Swagger UI listing `health`, `sites`, `kpis`, and `meta` endpoints. Try `GET /api/kpis` and confirm `total_sites` is `421`.

### Step 5 — Start the frontend

In a third terminal:

```
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # VITE_API_BASE_URL defaults to http://localhost:8000, matching Step 2
npm run dev
```

### Step 6 — Verify the app

Open http://localhost:5173 — the Dashboard should load with KPI cards (421 total sites, 356 total projects), breakdown charts (stage/commodity/region — click any bar to jump to the matching filtered Sites view — plus top-10 LGAs), a "projects with the most sites" panel, and a data-provenance strip. From there:
- **Sites** in the nav bar → a filterable, sortable, paginated table of all 421 sites (filters/sort/page are synced to the URL, so the link is shareable; **Export CSV** downloads the current filtered view in full)
- **Map** in the nav bar → all matching sites plotted on a map, colored by stage, with the same filters
- Click any site → its full detail page, including a "Related sites in this project" section when the project has more than one site
- Press **Ctrl+K** (or **⌘K**) anywhere, or click **Search sites** in the header → a global command palette; type to search, ↑/↓ to move, Enter to open a site directly

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `docker compose up` fails to connect / hangs | Docker Desktop isn't running — start it and wait for "Engine running" before retrying |
| Backend starts but `/api/sites` returns an empty list | Seed step (Step 3) hasn't been run yet, or hasn't finished |
| Frontend loads but shows no data / network errors in console | Backend isn't running, or `frontend/.env`'s `VITE_API_BASE_URL` doesn't match where the API is actually listening |
| `docker compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed` can't find the CSV | You're not running it from the repo root, or `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv` isn't present — see `DATABASES/README_database.md` (it's committed, so this normally shouldn't happen from a fresh clone) |

### Running the tests

```
# backend (from backend/, with requirements-dev.txt installed)
pytest

# frontend (from frontend/)
npm run test -- --run
```

Both run in CI on every push/PR to `main`. See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for what each suite actually covers.

### Key endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness check |
| `GET /api/sites` | Paginated site list; filter with `commodity`, `region`, `stage`, `site_type`, `project` (project_code — each repeatable for multi-select, e.g. `?region=Pilbara&region=Kimberley`), `search`; sort with `sort` (e.g. `?sort=-stage`, allowlisted, invalid values return 422) |
| `GET /api/sites/export` | The same filtered+sorted view as a CSV download (full result set, not one page); same `commodity`/`region`/`stage`/`site_type`/`search`/`sort` params. Header row uses the app's own labels ("Local Government Area"), not schema names (`lga_name`) |
| `GET /api/sites/{site_code}` | Single site detail |
| `GET /api/kpis` | Portfolio KPIs (totals + breakdowns by stage/type/commodity/region, top-10 LGAs, and multi-site projects ranked by site count), same filters as above |
| `GET /api/meta/filters` | Distinct filter values, for populating dropdowns |

```

## Production / Deployment

`docker-compose.yml` (used above) is for local development: it bind-mounts `backend/` for hot reload and runs `uvicorn --reload`. For a production-like build — no source mounts, no reload, the frontend built and served as static assets through nginx — use `docker-compose.prod.yml` instead:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python -m app.db.seed
```

- App (nginx, static build + reverse-proxied API): http://localhost:8080

Differences from the dev compose file: the backend runs without `--reload` and **has no host port mapping at all** — `frontend/nginx.conf` reverse-proxies `/api`, `/health`, `/docs`, and `/openapi.json` to the backend over the internal Compose network, so nginx (port 8080 locally, port 80 in the cloud) is the only thing reachable from outside the stack; the frontend is a multi-stage build (`frontend/Dockerfile`) — `npm run build` in a `node` stage, then served by `nginx` (which also handles the SPA fallback so client-side routes like `/sites/S0001538` don't 404 on a hard refresh); and Postgres isn't exposed to the host either. This is still a single-host Compose setup, not a multi-node cloud deployment — see Future Improvements for what's not covered (TLS, horizontal scaling, automated CD).

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main`: backend lint (`ruff`) + compile check + tests (`pytest`), and frontend tests (`vitest`) + typecheck + build (`tsc -b && vite build`). All must pass before merging.

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)

[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) is a step-by-step runbook for deploying this same `docker-compose.prod.yml` stack to a single free-tier-eligible AWS EC2 instance — architecture, an explicit cost/billing gate (checked before creating anything), launch/configure/deploy/verify steps, and teardown. **Not yet executed** — it requires AWS credentials this environment doesn't have configured.

## Setup / How to Run (legacy SQL + Power BI)

Running this pipeline standalone is useful for two things: the Power BI dashboard, or inspecting the SQL directly — and it's also how `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv` (the file the app itself seeds from) gets (re)generated when the raw dataset changes. For running the app day to day, see [Getting Started](#getting-started) above — you don't need to run any of this to do that, the cleaned CSV is already committed.

1. Install PostgreSQL locally (or use a scratch database in the app's own Postgres container — anywhere isolated from the app's live `wa_mining` database is fine, since `SQL/02` creates a `sites` table without checking whether one already exists).
2. Create the database and run the full pipeline:
   ```
   createdb wa_mining_pipeline
   psql -d wa_mining_pipeline -f SQL/run_all.sql
   ```
   This runs `01`→`05` in order and loads `DATABASES/raw/Major_Resource_Projects.csv` into `staging_sites` along the way. Run it from the repository root so the relative paths resolve.
3. Open `POWER_BI/wa_mining_dashboard_v2.pbix` in Power BI Desktop and refresh the data connection.
4. To regenerate the app's cleaned CSV from this run, export `sites` (via psql, from the same session):
   ```
   \copy sites TO 'DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/Major_Resource_Projects_Cleaned.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
   ```
   Then `docker compose exec backend python -m app.db.seed` (or the native equivalent) to load it into the app.

## Business Context

The dataset is sourced from DMIRS's MINEDEX Major Resource Projects export and covers WA's mining, mineral processing, and petroleum sites. In the CSV snapshot currently in this repo: 229 Mine sites, 158 Infrastructure sites, 33 Deposit sites, and 1 Other site, across 356 distinct projects. By stage: 261 Operating, 74 Proposed, 40 Care and Maintenance, 33 Undeveloped, 10 Under Development, and 3 Shut. Projects cluster regionally (e.g. iron ore concentrated in the Pilbara, gold in the Goldfields), which is one of the drill-downs the dashboard supports.

## Future Improvements

The full, current roadmap — delivered features, what's next and why, and the platform/infra backlog — lives in **[WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md)**. The notes below are narrower, code-level items worth keeping close to the code they describe:

- Not yet covered by `docker-compose.prod.yml` or the AWS deployment: TLS/custom domain, horizontal scaling, and full CD (CI lints, tests, and builds, but deployment itself is manual; see [Cloud Deployment (AWS)](#cloud-deployment-aws)).
- Test coverage is a starter set, not exhaustive — `backend/tests/` covers sort/filter logic and the `/api/sites` route; frontend covers `urlFilters` and `SitesTable`'s sort cycle. `/api/kpis`, `MultiSelect`, and the URL-sync effects in `SitesPage`/`MapPage` still have no direct tests.
- The `STAGE` bucketing gap is fixed in the app (`GET /api/kpis` groups dynamically, so `Undeveloped` and `Shut` are included) but `SQL/05_portfolio_summary.sql`'s own `portfolio_summary` rollup table still only buckets 4 of 6 stages — left as-is since that specific table isn't consumed by the app (unlike `01`–`03`'s output, which now is, via `DATABASES/Cleaned_Mining_Data/`).
- Decide whether to keep `POWER_BI/wa_mining_dashboard_v1.pbix` (superseded by v2) or remove it.
- Remove or repurpose the legacy `image.png` / `image-1.png` at the repo root now that screenshots live under `screenshots/` and `POWER_BI/screenshots/`.

## Related Experiments

- **[prototypes/unity-shift-supervisor-demo/](prototypes/unity-shift-supervisor-demo/)** — a small, separate Unity/C# prototype: a single-scene 3D view of a handful of the same mining sites, colored by stage, clickable for details. Built to explore what a spatial/XR-adjacent visualization direction could look like, and to demonstrate picking up the Unity/C# stack. **Not part of the analytics pipeline or the FastAPI/React app** — no shared code, no networking between them, different tech stack entirely. See its own README for exact scope (deliberately no backend, auth, multiplayer, or headset integration).
